h1. glz_custom_fields, unlimited custom fields

This plugin provides unlimited custom fields in Textpattern. You can create custom fields as selects, multi-selects, checkboxes, radio buttons and textareas - as well as the default text input fields. Predefine values can be set for custom fields and you can select a single default value (selects, multi-selects, checkboxes and radio buttons only).

h2. Time and date pickers

Time and date pickers are pretty straightforward to use. To set the required JavaScript and styling properly, please refer to the %(information)INSTALL% file that came with this plugin.

h2. Custom scripts

This is a rather complex and long sought-for piece of functionality, please refer to the %(information)my_image.php% file which contains inline explanations on how they should be used. The file came with the plugin, in the %(information)scripts/glz_custom_fields% folder.

h2. Default values

You can now define a single default value by adding curly brackets around a value like so: @{default value}@.

h2. Ranges

If you want to define ranges, create a new custom field with the following name e.g. @Price range &amp;pound;(after)@.

* @range@ - this is really important and *(warning)must* be present for the range to work correctly.
* @&amp;pound;@ - don't use straight symbols (like @€@ or @£@), instead use entity ones e.g. @&amp;euro;@ and @&amp;pound;@ are valid symbols.
* @(after)@ - don't leave any spaces after e.g. $ and (after). This basically says where to add the measuring unit (be it a currency or something like m³ etc.) - @(before)@ is default.

Ranges are defined 10-20, 21-30 etc. (no measuring units - they get pulled from the custom set name).
