h1. Unlimited Custom Fields for Textpattern – glz_custom_fields

This plugin removes the limit on the number of custom fields in Textpattern and also allows you to create a range of different custom field types:

* Text input (default)
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons
* Select dropdowns
* Multiselect boxes
* Textareas

You can specify a set of predefined values for selects, multi-selects, checkboxes and radio button custom fields, one of which may be set as the @{default value}@ by placing it in curly brackets.

In addition, there are three special custom field types:

h3(#time-and-date-pickers). Time and date pickers

Time and date pickers offer an easy way for users to specify dates and times in a consistent format. The *date format*, *first day of the week* and *start date* for the calendar can be set in the plugin preferences.

Similarly, the *time format* (24 or 12 hours), *start and end times* (e.g. @08:00@ and @19:00@) and *time step* (intervals, e.g. @30@ minutes) can be set in the plugin preferences.

_IMPORTANT: You must copy the "plugins/glz_custom_fields":https://github.com/jools-r/glz_custom_fields/dist/plugins/glz_custom_fields folder to your Textpattern installation directory and set the corresponding paths in the "plugin preferences":?event=prefs#prefs_group_glz_custom_f for the datepicker and timepicker to function correctly. To place them in another web-reachable location, just change the path settings in the preferences accordingly._

h3(#custom-scripts). Custom scripts

Custom scripts make it possible to build-in custom functionality, for example to pull in information from elsewhere in your site, by writing a corresponding php script to create the custom field. Please refer to "my_image.php":https://github.com/jools-r/glz_custom_fields/blob/master/dist/plugins/glz_custom_fields/my_images.php file as an example with inline explanations or ask on the forum for tips and examples.

h3(#ranges). Ranges

Ranges are not in themselves a special field type. If you want to define ranges, create a new ‘Text Input’ custom field with the following name e.g. @Price range &amp;pound;(after)@.

* @range@ - this *(warning)must* be present in the name for the custom field to be recognised as a range.
* @&amp;pound;@ - don't use straight symbols (like @€@ or @£@) but rather their "entities":http://www.amp-what.com/unicode/search/ e.g. @&amp;euro;@ and @&amp;pound;@ are valid symbols.
* @(after)@ - don't leave any spaces after e.g. @&amp;euro;@ and @(after)@. This basically says where to add the measuring unit (be it a currency or something like m³ etc.) - @(before)@ is default.

Ranges are defined @10-20@, @21-30@ etc. (no measuring units - they get pulled from the custom set name).

h3(#credits). Credits

This plugin was originally written by "Gerhard Lazu":https://github.com/gerhard and dates back to "2007":https://forum.textpattern.io/viewtopic.php?pid=157983#p157983. It has been repaired, expanded and adopted by numerous forum members over the years (credited in the code), most recently by "Bloke":https://github.com/Bloke/glz_custom_fields. This significantly refactored version adds compatibility with Textpattern v4.7 and is currently looked after by "jools-r":https://github.com/jools-r/glz_custom_fields. Its concept and core workings are still those of Gerhard's original plugin. The Textpattern core will ultimately support unlimited custom fields, making this plugin obsolete at some point in the future.
